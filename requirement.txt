Task 1:  XOR Problem



Implement BP algorithm and apply it to the XOR problem.



Input    Output

0 0         0

0 1         1

1 0         1

1 1         0



Objectives: 
1) Understand the details of BP algorithm; 
2) Understand the impact of various algorithm parameter settings; 
3) Understand the structure of the 2-2-1 feedforward network.



You should demonstrate the convergence of the networks under different settings and give a detailed analysis on how the trained network can solve this nonlinearly seperable probelm.



You need to code the BP algorithm by yourself for this assignment.



Task 2: Identity Function



Use the above implemented BP algorithm (with possible small changes) to solve the identity function problem in which the input is identical to the output.



The network has 8 input units, 3 hidden units and 8 output units.



There are 8 training samples and each one contains exactly seven 0s and a single 1.



For example:



Input                  Output



00010000        00010000

00000001        00000001



Objectives: 1) Train a network that can realize this identical mapping; 2) Understand the functionality of the 3 hidden units.



Hint: It is actually an 8-3-8 encoder&decoder. Try to discover the output pattern of the hidden units with regard to different input samples.
